When assembling WA-DoH metadata:
- Metadata was pulled from excel sheets posted in SFS Slack #data-transfer-nwgc
- county Unknown = missing
- Ages were listed as what I assumed to be birth dates for some WA-DoH samples. I converted these into age.
- After copying files from windows to rhino, be sure to save as file names without spaces AND convert from dos2unix.

The reference to align to is the same one Jover used for assembling the genomes: Wuhan/Hu-1/2019.

When new sequences are added to GISAID, do the following:
1. Delete everything in data folder except subfolder "wadoh_metadata"
2. Delete everything in results folder except subfolder, "vcfs"
3. Get sample numbers using this command:
    find /fh/fast/bedford_t/seattleflu/assembly-ncov/*/process/mpileup/sars-cov-2/*.pileup | sed "s/.*\//- /; s/\.pileup//"
4. Then manually add them to config.yaml
5. Download metabase as xlsx --> export as TSV --> transfer to rhino --> convert to unix format
6. Add in WA-DoH metadata to 'wadoh_metadata'
7. Source environment to download GISAID sequences and data
8. Run snakemake!
